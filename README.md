# Challenge-2

With this challenge I designed a webpage that I wanted to use for a future webpage that will display my design work.

I wanted to make a section of my page with an "About Me" section. There I can uplaod a short description of myself. With a link to a resume for a potential job.

Secondly, I wanted to make a section for my "Graphic Design" work. I wanted this page to showcase my skills as a graphic designer while uploading new designs I make in the future.

Thirdly, I wanted to make a section of my page as a  "Web Designer". There I can show case past pages I have make and show case code that I used and it fuctionality.

This was a difficult challenge for me. Hopefully with more learning I can imporve and make it better.
