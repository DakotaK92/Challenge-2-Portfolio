# Challenge-2

With this challenge I needed to design and deploy a portfolio site.

I made a slide show with things that I've learned and built. And I also put a photo of myself as a way to introduce myself.

Then I made some click-able objects to make the veiwer have an easy way to access my projects.

I then decided I wanted to have a section to have an introduction to myself and what skills I have.
